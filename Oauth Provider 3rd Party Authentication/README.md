# APIConnect Oauth Provider with Third Party Authentication 

In This project we have implemented the complete flow how APIconnect can be used with 3rd party Authentication services and still able to generate full OAuth flow capabitlies. Most of the enterprises have already created their own authentication service on an externally hosted server. Typically, the authentication service has already been branded with the enterprise look-and-feel and is deployed as a Web application,so they want to redirect the API Gateway to Authentication service and Extarct identity outside APIc.

More information can be extracted from IBM Official website: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMNED_2018/com.ibm.apic.apionprem.doc/oauth_redirect.html

We have created a our own 3rd Party Authentication service for better understanding of an end to end flow.
